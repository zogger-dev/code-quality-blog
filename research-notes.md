## The "AI Code Quality Crisis" (GitClear, 2024-2025)

A massive study of 211 million lines of code found that while AI has increased productivity, it has caused a measurable decline in code quality:

- **Refactoring is dying**: The percentage of "moved" or "refactored" code dropped from 25% (2021) to under 10% (2025). Developers are just "adding" instead of "organizing."

- **The Duplication Explosion**: Commits containing copy-pasted (duplicated) code blocks increased by 800% in 2024.

- **The DORA Stability Link**: Google's 2025 DORA report found that for every 25% increase in AI adoption, there was a 7.2% decrease in delivery stability (increased bug rates).

## PyQu: Quantifying "Quality Gains" (2026)

Researchers introduced PyQu, a tool that uses machine learning to identify "quality-enhancing commits."

- **Methodology**: Analyzes 3.7 million commits to see which ones actually improve reliability and modularity vs. just adding features.

- **Significance**: Proves that we can now predict if a commit will improve long-term maintainability with ~85% accuracy based purely on low-level structural metrics.
