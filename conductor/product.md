# Product Guide

## Initial Concept
Over the course of the past several months, I've repeatedly given similar advice across multiple PRs. The comments I wrote included pretty dense information that should be condensed into a consumable format and disseminated widely. I want to write a blog or mini-blog with excellent examples of anti-patterns to avoid and best practices to follow.

## Target Audience
- Junior to Mid-level Developers seeking to improve their code quality.
- Senior Developers looking for specific examples to share in their own reviews.

## Product Goals
- To educate developers on specific, recurring code quality issues.
- To provide a quick reference library of "Do's and Don'ts" for code reviews.
- To foster a culture of better coding practices within the community.

## Technology Focus
- **Language:** Java

## Content Structure & Format
- **Scope:** Each entry ("mini-blog") must focus on a single anti-pattern.
- **Length:** Concise enough to fit on a single printed page.
- **Standard Layout:**
    1.  **Anti-pattern Description:** clear definition of the issue.
    2.  **"Bad" Code Example:** A realistic snippet demonstrating the anti-pattern.
    3.  **"Good" Code Example:** The corrected, idiomatic approach.
    4.  **The "Why":** Detailed explanation of the reasoning.
    5.  **Impact Analysis:** Summary of the impact on reliability, maintainability, or performance.
    6.  **References:** (Optional) External links to documentation or standard texts (e.g., Effective Java).
